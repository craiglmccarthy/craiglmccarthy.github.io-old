This month mostly consisted of readings. I made my way through *HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites* (Jon Duckett, 2011), *JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development* (Jon Duckett, 2013), and I started *Python for Data Analysis* (McKinney, 2017).

The web development books served as both a refresher (I've already got quite a bit of experience regarding HTML and CSS) and a primer for the freeCodeCamp courses that I hope to start in August. I quite liked both books but was aware that they were heavily dated in quite a lot of areas.

In addition to starting the McKinney book, I signed up to and completed the following courses on DataCamp:

* Introduction to Python
* Intermediate Python for Data Science
* Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)
* Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)
