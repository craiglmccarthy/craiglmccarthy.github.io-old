This month was a bit busier than the previous month.

I have decided to take a break from DataCamp and have decided to hit up the books instead. I'll return to
DataCamp after I've finished reading -

- _Python for Data Analysis_ (Wes McKinney, 2017)
- _Data Science from Scratch_ (Joel Grus, 2019)

I started to watch the 2019 CS50 lectures from Harvard University, CS50 being an introductory computer science course. The lectures so far have covered - Scratch, C, arrays, algorithms, and memory. I've been really impressed by the course - especially its high quality production values.

I read _Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps_ (Drescher, 2017) and _Digital Gold: The Untold Story of Bitcoin_ (Popper, 2016). The first book provided a good overview of how blockchain works and its application in the wider world. The second book provided a fascinating history of bitcoin.

I completed the following freeCodeCamp projects for the Responsive Web Design Certification - Tribute Page, Survey Form, Product Landing Page (only 2 more to go!).

I did a bit more work on the _Doc-o-matic_ - I managed to get it to communicate with my work's taxonomy server using API calls. This enables the _Doc-o-matic_ to generate subject classification fields in the MARC records. I also did some practical data wrangling using pandas on data obtained from the library LMS.
