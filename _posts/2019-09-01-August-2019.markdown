This month was fairly quiet on the coding front. The first half of the month was largely taken up by a visit to Poland - to the cities of Krakow and Warsaw. I had a great time and I definitely had my fair share of pierogi.

Here's the progress that I made in August -

* I read *JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development* (Jon Duckett, 2013) and *Superintelligence* (Bostrom, 2014)

* I started freeCodeCamp and completed most of the Responsive Web Design Certification (excluding the final projects). I managed to put together some design mock-ups for the final projects and hope to get them completed by the end of September

* I started working my way through [https://internetingishard.com/](https://internetingishard.com/) - which I've found to be a really good resource

* I completed the following modules on DataCamp - *Cleaning Data in Python*; *Introduction to Data Science in Python*; *Pandas Foundations*; and *Manipulating DataFrames with pandas*

Since deciding to record my learning progress, I've kept a rough record of the hours spent each day. I've put together some data visualisations using pandas/Matplotlib, which you can see below, styled in xkcd :) -
