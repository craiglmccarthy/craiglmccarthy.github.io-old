The greatest achievement of October was that I finally managed to finish the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It took a lot longer than I had originally anticipated; though towards the end I think I had got my workflows figured out. Next stop - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

I also bought a Raspberry Pi to do some coding on while I'm at work. I actually had one of these a number of years ago, I had the Pi 2. However, I'm really impressed with the power of the new model - I think you could definitely run it as a main desktop computer. The screenshot below shows the _Doc-o-matic_ running on Raspbian. I've also got a few projects planned specifically for the Raspberry Pi.

I read:

- _Python for Data Analysis_ (Wes McKinney, 2017)
- _Principles of Data Wrangling: Practical Techniques for Data Preparation_ (Rattenbury, 2017)
- _Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction_ (Gowers, 2002)

I completed:

- Technical Documentation Page (freeCodeCamp project)
- Personal Portfolio Website Page (freeCodeCamp project)

I watched:

- CS-50 Data Structures
- CS-50 Python
- CS-50 SQL

I started reading:

- _Make your own neural network_ (Rashid, 2016)
